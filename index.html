                Hello! I'm Tharun Jamal, a passionate tech enthusiast with a keen interest in programming. I have completed my under graduation at the NRI Institute of Technology in India. After my under graduation, I got a job offer from Wipro but to improve my knowledge doing master's at GVSU might help.

            <h2>My Term Project</h2>
            <p>
                In the recent semester, I developed "Art Gallery," an online art gallery platform tailored to bridge the gap between emerging artists and art aficionados. The platform empowers artists with tools to showcase their work, while art enthusiasts enjoy a curated experience to discover and purchase unique pieces. Prioritizing security, I integrated phone number authentication for genuine user registrations. The dynamic profile system, coupled with an intuitive navigation interface, ensures both artists and buyers have a personalized, engaging experience. This project symbolizes my commitment to enriching the art community by leveraging digital solutions.
